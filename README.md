## Based on Original Work

This project is based on the [amazon-eks-kubernetes-api-aws-lambda](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-kubernetes-api-aws-lambda) sample by AWS.

### üîß Modifications include:

## 1. AWS Profile Selection

The deployment script now prompts:

> "Are you using multiple AWS profiles?"

- If you answer **yes**, it will list available profiles and let you choose one.
- If you answer **no**, it proceeds using the default AWS credentials (from `aws configure`, environment variables, or IAM role).

No extra configuration is required if you're already authenticated with default credentials.

## 2. Lambda Code Refactored into Two Files

The Lambda function code has been modularized for clarity and maintainability:

- **`lambda_function.py`**: The main Lambda handler triggered by API Gateway.
- **`kubeconfig.py`**: A helper module that:
  - Retrieves the Kubernetes authentication token using the AWS EKS API.
  - Returns a valid `kubeconfig` structure for temporary access.

This separation makes the code easier to read, test, and extend.
‚û°Ô∏è It also helps you to focus on editing only the main Lambda logic, where you can use any Kubernetes API you want ‚Äî such as interacting with pods, deployments, services, or other resources ‚Äîwithout needing to modify or navigate the underlying authentication code.
